# 01_Atmega

**BASIC Concept**  
AVR 8bit Microcontroller 
- The basic unit of the program memory in the Atmega128 is a word.
  
1) 16MPS - 16 millon commands
2) Volatile Memory : Memory that loses its contents when power is turned off (RAM)
3) Nonvolatile Memory : Memory that not loses its contents when power is turned off(ROM, Flash)  
4) SRAM(Static RAM)
5) DRAM(Dynamic Random Access Memory) : type of volatile memory that uses capacitors to store data and requires periodic refreshing to maintain its contents.

**Register** 
Status Register(SPEG) 
- This register is a read-write register for the MCU, and it shows the status of the operation result.
